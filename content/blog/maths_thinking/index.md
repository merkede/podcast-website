Carl Friedrich Gauss, one of the most important mathmaticians of all time, was a prodigy at a young age (or so the story goes). One day, his teacher asked the class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100. Gauss quickly figured that adding the first number with the last, (100+1), resulted in 101. In fact, adding 99 and 2, or 98 and 3 also resulted in 101. There were in fact 50 pairs of 101 between 0 and 100.

### Mathemtical Thinking - first thing is first

As humans, we love order. The saying goes 'first thing is first'. But as Gauss was able to show there is benefit in having the end in mind before beginning. In fact, this type of thinking is key in mathematics - suprisingly much of mathematics revolves around shorcuts. By adding the end and beginning at the offset, Gauss was applying Amazon's philosophy of 'working backwards' from a problem but also thinking outside the box.

Many times at work and in our projects, we jump into work without having the end in mind. There is a belief that we need to re-invent the wheel, we need to start from scratch, "first thing is first". Rarely do we ever search the world wide web/pick up a book and perform a thorough 'literture review' as a means of understanding what currently exists, what solutions have worked or not worked. In similar vain to Gauss, why not explore different thinking and shortcuts rather than a linear, brute force approach.

Consider a data science project:

##### Beginning

Identifying the 'lay of the land' , understanding what data is available, where the data exists, initial blockers and problems. Sprint Zero

##### End

How is the model going to be served (cloud, api (fast api), batch inference, streaming), how is it going to be productionised , how is it going to be monitored?

##### End

Consider both the beginning and end in mind when formulating the problem
